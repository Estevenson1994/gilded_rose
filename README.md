### Gilded Rose Ruby Solution

This is my solution the the [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) Kata in Ruby.

## Instructions for use:

- Clone/download this repositiory
- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
- Run `rspec` to run tests

## My Approach

When tackling this challenge, the first step I took was to write tests to cover all possible cases (excluding conjured items).

I then focuses on writing less complex code for each item, starting with Aged Brie.
Once I had the tests passing for that item, I extracted out the item into a module and focused on encasulation, cohesion and code readability.
